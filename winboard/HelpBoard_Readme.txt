Basis of Program

The idea is to use xBoard as the basis of a program designed to assist a chess player with analysis of games.

Whilst I have some substantive ideas these will require some major changes and additions to the existing program and the project may, therefore stall.

CAUTION: I am learning Visual C++ as I go, so the changes so don't expect stylish or effective C++ programming here!
